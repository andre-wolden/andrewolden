    "My wife and I live in Oslo, Norway. We have two awesome children, the first born in 2016 and the second in 2020. Back when I was a student I didn't really know what I wanted to study. But I liked math, computers and nerdy stuff of course. Since I thought understanding computers and code would be way too difficult I chose to study something related to mathematics instead. So I chose thermodynamics and fluidmechanics. A long story short it all started with Matlab in school. I used it when I worked on fluid mechanics problems. My first job was somewhat partly related to fluidmechanics. During those five years I took on more and more software related tasks. In the end I managed to switch to a pure software developer position. I didn't know I liked it so much, but thankfully I eventually managed to figure that out. It is so much fun that it feels like cheating when I'm allowed to program at work. Since that's what I normally to in my spear time anyway. "
